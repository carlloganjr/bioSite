                Laura's favorite things to do consist of reading, writing, 
                and hiking. These all seem to flow together as one can lead 
                to another. When she makes time to read, her favorite author, 
                Fredrik Backman, captures the nuances of human nature on every 
                page. Poetry is another enjoyable reading activity for Laura 
                and has also led her to appreciate spoken word poetry. As well 
                as enjoying poetry and the spoken word, Laura writes in both 
                genres as an outlet for her creativity. Her spoken word poetry 
                has led to performances across the United States, and she hopes 
                to perform again in the future. She has also written for 
                newspapers and magazines throughout her career.

                Aside from reading and writing, Laura enjoys traveling and 
                hiking. She has hiked in many places throughout the nation, 
                enjoying the mountains of Utah the most. Travel has presented 
                her with a chance to try new things on a continual basis. Her 
                favorite places to travel are mostly the National Parks since 
                they were great destinations to experience wonderful adventures. 
                She has been to half of the National Parks, of which there are 
                63, and plans to see the remainder. She has also been to 
                numerous National Monuments, Memorials, and Forests along the 
                way. Her favorite National Monument is Craters of the Moon where 
                she went spelunking for the first time. The experience made her 
                feel empowered when she overcame her fear of being in a dark cave 
                with no way out. She kept going in the cave and eventually came 
                to an end and the exit, which was an incredible accomplishment 
                for her. When Laura has finished a day of reading, writing, 
                hiking, traveling, and spelunking she loves to sit down with a 
                cup of tea to relax for the rest of the day.
